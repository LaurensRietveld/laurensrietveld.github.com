        <p><i>Title</i>: Linking Data on the Web and within Enterprises</p>
        <i>Abstract</i>:
        <p>
        In the last years, the Linked Data concept gained wide attention for
        integrating distributed, heterogeneous data on the Web and within
        enterprises. In this talk, we discuss some crucial research and
        technology challenges of the Linked Data management life-cycle including
        extraction, linking, quality assurance, authoring and visualization. We
        look at existing and promising future Linked Data applications in the
        Digital Humanities/Cultural Heritage, Enterprise Data and Internet of
        Thing/Industry 4.0 domains.</p>
        <i>Bio</i>:
        <p>Sören heads the Enterprise Information Systems group at the computer science department at University of Bonn. He is also member of the leadership council of Fraunhofer-Insitute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS) and scientific head of the Fraunhofer IAIS department Organized Knowledge. Before joining University of Bonn and Fraunhofer IAIS in 2013, Sören founded AKSW research group at University of Leipzig and worked at TU Chemnitz as well as University of Pennsylvania.</p>

        <b>13.45, Prof.dr, Stefan Decker</b><br>
        <p><i>Title</i>: Knowledge Representation on the Web revisited: the case for Prototypes</p>
        <i>Abstract</i>:
        <p>In recent years RDF and OWL have become the most common
        knowledge representation languages in use on the Web,
        propelled by the recommendation of the W3C.
        In this talk I will report on some work to develop a case for using a different
        approach for representing knowledge on the Web.
        I argue, that an approach, based on Prototypes, is more suitable
        than the currently available paradigms for representing knowledge on the Web.
        I will discuss requirements and design principles for Knowledge
        Representation based on Prototypes on the Web, after which
        I propose a formal syntax and semantics. I report on
        an implementation and on the usability of the system.
        The presented work is jointly done with Michael Cochez (University of
        Jyvaskyla).</p>
